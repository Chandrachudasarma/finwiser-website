            <h2>4. Scope of Platform Services and Role Clarity</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Nature of Platform Services</h3>
            <p>The Platform provides technology-enabled tools and features that allow Users to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>organise and view financial information,</li>
                <li>run calculations, simulations, and projections,</li>
                <li>access educational content and financial insights,</li>
                <li>receive Generic Outputs generated through automated systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These Platform services are designed to assist Users in understanding financial concepts and exploring scenarios. <strong>They are not a substitute for personalised financial advice.</strong></p>

            <h3>4.2 Generic Outputs and Non-Advisory Nature</h3>
            <p>Any Generic Outputs displayed on the Platform:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>are generated using automated rules, models, or algorithms,</li>
                <li>are based on limited or partial information provided by the User and/or accessed with consent,</li>
                <li>do not consider the User's complete financial situation, constraints, or suitability.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>Accordingly:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generic Outputs do not constitute "investment advice", "recommendations", or "research reports" under the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013.</li>
                    <li>Users acknowledge that Generic Outputs are provided for informational and educational purposes only and must not be relied upon as personalised advice.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Performance Validation Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>Users acknowledge that Generic Outputs, including simulations, projections, back-tests, or hypothetical illustrations, represent mathematical or statistical hypotheses based on stated assumptions.</p>
            <p>Unless expressly identified as validated, such outputs have not been audited, verified, or certified by a SEBI-recognised Performance Validation Agency (PVA) and must not be construed as performance claims or assurances.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Investment Advisory Services Are Separately Governed</h3>
            <p>Personalised investment advice ("Investment Advice") is provided only where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the User has completed the required onboarding and risk profiling;</li>
                <li>the User has executed a valid Investment Advisory Agreement with Finwiser; and</li>
                <li>advice is explicitly identified as such.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Investment Advisory Agreement exclusively governs: scope of advice, suitability obligations, fees and refunds, fiduciary duties, and grievance redressal for advisory services.</p>
            <p><strong>Nothing in these Platform Terms shall be interpreted as creating an advisory relationship.</strong></p>

            <h3>4.4 No Execution, Distribution, or Product Placement</h3>
            <p>Finwiser does not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>execute transactions,</li>
                <li>place orders,</li>
                <li>distribute financial products,</li>
                <li>receive commissions, referral fees, or indirect incentives from product manufacturers or intermediaries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the Platform provides links, redirections, or exports to third-party execution platforms, such links are provided solely for User convenience, they constitute user-initiated redirections, and Finwiser has no control over execution outcomes.</p>
            <p>Finwiser does not receive any direct or indirect economic benefit, including non-cash incentives or "soft dollars", from such third parties.</p>

            <h3>4.5 Third-Party Services and Independence</h3>
            <p>The Platform may integrate or interoperate with Third-Party Services, including but not limited to: Account Aggregators, data providers, communication and hosting services, and identity or verification services.</p>
            <p>Such Third-Party Services are governed by their own terms and policies, independent of Finwiser's advisory role, and used at the User's discretion.</p>
            <p>Finwiser is not responsible for the performance, availability, or acts or omissions of third-party providers, except as required under Applicable Law.</p>

            <h3>4.6 No Guarantee of Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Use of the Platform, including reliance on Generic Outputs, does not guarantee: financial performance, achievement of goals, accuracy of projections, or suitability for any particular User.</p>
            <p>Financial markets are subject to risk, uncertainty, and external factors beyond Finwiser's control.</p>

            <h2>6. Account Aggregator (AA), FIU Access, and Purpose-Limited Use of Financial Information</h2>

            <h3>6.1 Consent-Based Access Through the Account Aggregator Framework</h3>
            <p>Where enabled on the Platform, Finwiser may act as a Financial Information User (FIU) and request access to a User's Financial Information (FI) through one or more RBI-regulated Account Aggregators (AA).</p>
            <p>Such access shall occur only pursuant to the User's explicit, informed, and revocable consent, obtained through the AA framework in accordance with Applicable Law.</p>
            <p>Finwiser does not access, fetch, or process any FI without User consent, outside the scope, duration, or purpose specified in the consent artefact, or in a manner inconsistent with AA ecosystem rules.</p>

            <h3>6.2 Nature of FI Access (Read-Only and Non-Transactional)</h3>
            <p>Access to FI through the AA framework is strictly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>read-only;</strong></li>
                <li><strong>non-transactional;</strong> and</li>
                <li><strong>non-discretionary.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finwiser cannot initiate transactions, move funds, modify accounts, or exercise control over any financial product or account.</p>
            <p>All execution and control remain exclusively with the User and the relevant financial institutions.</p>

            <h3>6.3 Purpose-Driven Processing & Service Evolution</h3>
            <p>Finwiser acts as a Data Fiduciary. We process Financial Information (FI) accessed through the AA framework only for purposes that provide direct value to you. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consolidated Financial Health Mapping:</strong> Aggregating fragmented assets and liabilities to compute your real-time Net Worth and Solvency ratios.</li>
                <li><strong>Investable Surplus & Cashflow Optimization:</strong> Analysing income and spending patterns to identify "hidden" surplus, optimize emergency buffers, and ensure debt-servicing (EMI) sustainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive Goal Modeling:</strong> Running simulations to determine the probability of achieving life goals (Retirement, Education, etc.) based on your actual account trajectories.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalised Suitability & Risk Monitoring:</strong> (For Clients) Ensuring investment recommendations stay within your risk capacity and automatically alerting you if your asset allocation drifts beyond target thresholds.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligent Service Enhancements & Value Discovery:</strong> Processing data to identify opportunities for financial optimization, such as Tax Efficiency Insights, Protection Gap Analysis, and Cost Optimization.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory & Safety Audits:</strong> Maintaining an evidence-based audit trail of your financial state at the time of advice to comply with SEBI Suitability and Record-keeping norms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>FI shall not be used for marketing or solicitation, cross-selling of financial products, profiling for unrelated purposes, or any purpose not explicitly disclosed and consented to.</p>

            <h3>6.4 Consent Lifecycle and User Control</h3>
            <p>You retain full control over your FI consent and may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>grant consent for specific accounts, data types, and durations;</li>
                <li>revoke consent at any time through the AA ecosystem; and</li>
                <li>modify consent parameters in accordance with AA rules.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon revocation or expiry of consent, Finwiser shall cease further access to FI and processing shall be limited to what is required under Applicable Law, including regulatory record-keeping obligations.</p>

            <h3>6.5 Data Quality, Availability, and Dependency</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge that FI availability depends on participating financial institutions, the AA ecosystem, and external systems; data may be delayed, incomplete, or unavailable in certain cases; and Finwiser does not control the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of FI provided by third parties.</p>
            <p>Finwiser does not warrant that FI fetched through AA will reflect real-time or exhaustive financial positions.</p>

            <h3>6.6 Storage, Retention, and Security of FI</h3>
            <p>FI is handled in accordance with the <a href="https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Digital%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Act%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023</a>, RBI Account Aggregator guidelines, SEBI record-keeping requirements, and Finwiser's internal security policies.</p>
            <p>FI is stored securely using industry-standard safeguards, retained only for as long as required for the stated purpose or Applicable Law, and subject to deletion, anonymisation, or archival in accordance with Finwiser's Data Retention and Erasure Policy.</p>

            <h3>6.7 No Sale or Monetisation of Financial Information</h3>
            <p><strong>Finwiser does not sell, rent, trade, or monetise FI.</strong></p>
            <p>Aggregated or anonymised data that cannot identify you may be used for analytics, system improvement, risk management, or lawful business purposes, in accordance with Applicable Law.</p>

            <h3>6.8 Third-Party Roles and Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Account Aggregators and financial institutions operate independently of Finwiser and are governed by their respective terms, policies, and regulatory obligations.</p>
            <p>Finwiser is not responsible for failures or delays in FI delivery caused by third parties, acts or omissions of AAs or financial institutions, or availability of specific accounts or data types, except to the extent required under Applicable Law.</p>

            <h3>6.9 AA Ecosystem Participant Responsibilities (FIU)</h3>
            <p>Finwiser, in its capacity as a Financial Information User (FIU), acknowledges its rights and responsibilities as an AA ecosystem participant and undertakes to comply with applicable AA ecosystem rules, standards, and participation terms governing FIU conduct, including consent-based access, purpose limitation, secure handling, retention restrictions, and restrictions on onward sharing.</p>

            <h2>12. Limitation of Liability (Platform Services Only)</h2>

            <h3>12.1 Scope of Limitation</h3>
            <p>This Section applies only to your access to and use of the Platform, including its tools, features, Generic Outputs, content, and technology-enabled functionality.</p>
            <p>It does not apply to personalised investment advice provided under a valid Investment Advisory Agreement or liabilities that cannot be excluded or limited under Applicable Law.</p>

            <h3>12.2 Model, Projection, and Technology Risk</h3>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that the Platform may utilise automated rules, algorithms, statistical models, or artificial intelligence systems; third-party data sources; and user-provided inputs to generate Generic Outputs, including projections, simulations, benchmarks, alerts, or generic recommendations.</p>
            <p>Such outputs are inherently probabilistic and assumption-based; dependent on data quality, availability, and external conditions; and subject to model limitations, simplifications, and changes over time.</p>
            <p>Finwiser does not represent or warrant that any Generic Output will be accurate, complete, or achieved in practice.</p>

            <h4>Algorithmic Limitations and Bias</h4>
            <p>Users acknowledge that algorithms, models, and scoring frameworks may reflect inherent limitations or model bias arising from underlying assumptions, historical data patterns, simplifications, or constraints in data availability.</p>
            <p>Such models are periodically reviewed and updated; however, they may not fully capture behavioural, market, or regulatory changes in real time.</p>

            <h3>12.3 No Liability for Decisions Based on Platform Outputs</h3>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, Finwiser shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or adverse outcome arising from reliance on Generic Outputs by Users who have not entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement, decisions taken independently by Users based on Platform information, or use of the Platform for purposes beyond its intended functionality.</p>

            <h3>12.4 Exclusion of Indirect and Consequential Damages</h3>
            <p>To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Finwiser shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits or opportunity, loss of data, business interruption, or reputational harm, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Platform.</p>

            <h3>12.5 Liability Cap for Platform Services</h3>
            <p>Where liability cannot be excluded under Applicable Law and relates solely to Platform services (and not investment advisory services):</p>
            <p>Finwiser's aggregate liability shall be limited to the fees, if any, paid by you for Platform access in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
            <p>Where no Platform fees have been paid, liability shall be limited to a nominal amount as required under Applicable Law.</p>

            <h3>12.6 Statutory and Regulatory Carve-Out</h3>
            <p>Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit liability arising from wilful misconduct or fraud, override obligations imposed under the <a href="https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/regulations/jan-2020/securities-and-exchange-board-of-india-investment-advisers-regulations-2013-last-amended-on-january-23-2020-_45791.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013</a>, or restrict statutory rights or remedies available to Users under Applicable Law.</p>

            <h2>13. Suspension, Termination, and Account Closure</h2>

            <h3>13.1 User-Initiated Closure</h3>
            <p>You may request closure or deactivation of your Account at any time through the Platform or by contacting support.</p>
            <p>For security reasons, Finwiser may require reasonable verification before processing an account closure request. Finwiser will process closure requests within a reasonable period, subject to completion of verification and resolution of any pending security checks.</p>
            <p>Upon Account closure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>your access to the Platform will be disabled;</li>
                <li>active sessions (including any ongoing data fetch sessions) may be terminated; and</li>
                <li>ongoing processing of User Data shall cease except to the extent required for: (i) compliance with Applicable Law or regulatory record-keeping; (ii) fraud prevention, security, or audit; or (iii) resolution of disputes, complaints, or enforcement matters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Account closure does not automatically revoke Account Aggregator consents granted by you through the AA ecosystem. You may revoke such consents through your Account Aggregator, and Finwiser will honour revocation in accordance with Applicable Law and AA ecosystem rules.</p>

            <h3>13.2 Finwiser-Initiated Suspension or Termination</h3>
            <p>Finwiser may suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Platform (in whole or in part) where Finwiser reasonably determines that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>such action is required under Applicable Law or a regulatory/judicial direction;</li>
                <li>it is necessary to protect Platform security, integrity, or other Users;</li>
                <li>there is reasonable suspicion of fraud, misuse, unlawful activity, or unauthorised access;</li>
                <li>you materially breach these Terms; or</li>
                <li>continuation of access poses a material regulatory, legal, security, or reputational risk.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where practicable and not prohibited by Applicable Law, Finwiser may provide notice of suspension/termination and, where appropriate, an opportunity to address the issue.</p>

            <h3>13.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
            <p>Termination or suspension shall not affect rights or obligations accrued prior to termination or relieve either party from obligations that are intended to survive termination, including obligations relating to data protection, confidentiality, disputes, and compliance with Applicable Law.</p>
            <p>Finwiser may restore access where a suspension was applied due to an error or where the underlying issue is resolved, subject to Applicable Law and risk controls.</p>
